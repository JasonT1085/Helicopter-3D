# Objectives

* Download Unity and get familiar with its interface.

* Read and understand all of the Helicopter Game 3D source code from Lecture 8.

* Add Gems to the game that spawn in much the same way as Coins, though more rarely so. Gems should be worth 5 coins when collected and despawn when off the left edge of the screen.

* Fix the bug whereby the scroll speed of planes, coins, and buildings doesnâ€™t reset when the game is restarted via the space bar.
